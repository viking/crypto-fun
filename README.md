Fun with crypto
---------------

This repo contains some scripts that make cryptography fun:

### Vigenère cipher

The script `vigenere.rb` creates a
[Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipher) that
can be used to encode a given plaintext to a desired ciphertext. The point of
this is to demonstrate that decrypting a ciphertext can yield intelligible (but
possibly invalid) plaintext results.
